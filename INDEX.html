    <h1> RYOMEN SAKUNA </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;" class="para">Ryomen Sukuna more often referred to as simply Sukuna is the strongest jujutsu sorcerer from a thousand years ago. Regarded as the undisputed King of Curses Sukuna is one of the primary antagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series.

        According to legend, Sukuna was an Imaginary Demon during the Heian Era but in truth he was a sorcerer also known as the Disgraced One Jujutsu sorcerers of the Golden Age of Jujutsu gave their all against him but ultimately fell one after another. Sukuna existed throughout the ages by transforming into a cursed object after death, a state where he split his power into twenty indestructible fingers.
        
        Sukuna was incarnated in June 2018 when Yuji Itadori consumed one of his fingers. Sukuna was trapped inside Yuji's body and was rarely in control until he managed to transfer his soul into the body of Megumi Fushiguro.
